Let's design your computer
===

## Step-by-step design guide

1. [Register file](#register-file)
2. Bit format
3. Instruction Set Architecture
4. Datapath for each instruction
5. Assembly language
6. Assembler
7. Emulator
8. CPU written by VHDL
9. Compile on FPGA
10. Load memory initialization file
11. Run your program on your computer

### 1. Register file
How many registers do you need?

### 2. Bit format
How do you devide bits into parts?

### 3. Instruction Set Architecture
All assembly mnemonics should be defined.

### Welcome to Github Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tanamim/MIN16/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tanamim/MIN16/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
